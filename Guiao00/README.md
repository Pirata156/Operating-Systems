## Script 00
------------
Script of exercises precious to the classes subjects itself as a reminder of the use of C pointers, GNU debugger and Valgrind.

### Used data structure
So to try and follow it as closely as possible to the script, making the structure as a linked list, where each node keeps the information about the initial free space and how many spaces free it covers.
